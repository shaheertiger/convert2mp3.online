        One of the most common questions we receive is: <em>"Is this legal?"</em> The answer lies in the nuance between personal use and distribution. This guide explains the landscape of media conversion in 2026.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">The Concept of "Time-Shifting" & "Format-Shifting"</h2>
      <p>
        Many legal jurisdictions recognize <strong>Format-Shifting</strong> (converting content from one medium to another, e.g., Video to MP3) for personal use as a fair practice, similar to recording a TV show to VHS in the 90s ("Time-Shifting").
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">You CANNOT Do the Following:</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-slate-400">
        <li><strong>Distribute Copyrighted Works</strong>: You cannot convert a copyrighted song and then host it on your own website or share the file with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Bypass DRM</strong>: Circumventing "Digital Rights Management" encryption is illegal in the US (DMCA) and EU. Convert2MP3 does not decrypt DRM-protected content (like Spotify or Netflix streams). We only access publicly available non-DRM streams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-4">Terms of Service vs. Law</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to distinguish between breaking a website's Terms of Service (ToS) and breaking the law. YouTube's ToS prohibits downloading without a "Download" button. violating ToS may result in account bans from that platform, but it is a civil breach of contract, not necessarily a criminal act, unless copyright infringement is involved.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-8 text-slate-400">
        <strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Convert2MP3 is a tool designed for archiving public domain content, Creative Commons works, and personal media backup. Always respect the rights of content creators.
