        It's the elephant in the room. Every time someone pastes a link into a converter, they wonder for a split second: <em>"Am I breaking the law?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer isn't a simple "Yes" or "No". It's a spectrum. It depends on <strong>what</strong> you convert, <strong>why</strong> you convert it, and <strong>where</strong> you live. In this guide, we'll demystify the legal landscape of 2026, stripping away the legalese to give you the plain facts.

                <p class="text-slate-400 text-sm m-0">
                    This is where "Personal Use" comes in. Many jurisdictions recognize the right to <strong>Format Shift</strong>—taking content you lawfully access (like a free YouTube video) and changing its format (to MP3) for personal convenience.
                    <br/><br/>
                    <em>Think of it like recording a song from the radio onto a cassette tape in the 90s.</em> It was widely accepted as legal for personal listening, as long as you didn't sell the tape.

                <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mt-0 mb-2">The Red Zone: Do Not Enter</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-400 text-sm m-0">
                    <strong>Distribution.</strong> This is the big no-no. If you convert a Top 40 hit and then email the MP3 to 10 friends, or host it on your own website for download, or try to sell it—that is Copyright Infringement. 
                    <br/><br/>
                    <strong>DRM Breaking.</strong> Using tools to strip encryption from Netflix, Spotify, or paid content is strictly illegal under the DMCA (USA) and EUCD (Europe). Convert2MP3 does <strong>not</strong> touch DRM-protected content.

      <!-- TOS vs LAW -->
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-16 mb-6">Terms of Service ≠ The Law</h2>
      <div class="bg-indigo-900/20 p-8 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-indigo-400">
        <p class="text-slate-300 italic m-0">
            "But YouTube's Terms say I can't download!"
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Correct. YouTube's Terms of Service (ToS) state you shouldn't download content without a download button. However, breaking a ToS is a civil breach of contract between you and a company. It is generally not a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you violate the ToS, YouTube has the right to ban your account. In reality, they rarely pursue individuals for personal downloading, focusing instead on large-scale piracy operations. But it's important to know: <strong>You are breaking the house rules, even if you aren't necessarily breaking the country's laws.</strong>
      </p>

        If you love an artist, <strong>support them</strong>. Buy their merch, go to their concerts, or stream them on official platforms to boost their stats. Use converters for the rare stuff, the remixes, the speeches, and the content that simply isn't available anywhere else.
