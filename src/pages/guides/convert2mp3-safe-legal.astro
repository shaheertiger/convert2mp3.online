                <h3>The Concept of "Private Copy" (European Union)</h3>
                <p>
                    In many European countries (like Germany, Netherlands,
                    France), there is a legal concept known as <em
                        >Privatkopie</em
                    > (Private Copy). This generally allows individuals to make copies
                    of copyright-protected media for <strong
                        >private, non-commercial use</strong
                    >, provided that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The source was legally accessed (e.g., watching a public
                        YouTube video).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No effective copy-protection measures (DRM) are
                        bypassed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The file is strictly for personal use (not shared or
                        sold).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>"Fair Use" and Time-Shifting (USA)</h3>
                <p>
                    In the United States, the legal ground is debated. The
                    famous <em>Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios</em> (Betamax
                    case) established that "time-shifting" (recording a broadcast
                    to watch later) is fair use. Many argue that downloading a video
                    to listen to offline falls under this category.
                </p>

                <h3>When is it Definitely Illegal?</h3>
                <p>
                    Regardless of where you live, the following actions are
                    almost always illegal:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Downloading copyrighted music to use in your own
                        commercial projects (videos, games) without a license.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sharing the downloaded MP3s on file-sharing sites
                        (Torrenting).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bypassing paywalls (e.g., downloading from Netflix or
                        Spotify Premium).
                    </li>
                </ul>
