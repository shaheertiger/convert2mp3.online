      <p class="text-white/60 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Google uses cookies to serve ads on our Site. Google's use of the DoubleClick cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to you based on your visit to our Site and/or other sites on the Internet. The DoubleClick cookie is used by Google in the ads served on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google AdSense ads or participating in Google advertising networks.

      <p class="text-white/60 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Google may serve personalized ads based on your browsing history and interests, or non-personalized ads based on contextual information. Personalized advertising uses data collected over time across different websites and apps to create a profile about you and show relevant ads. Non-personalized ads are targeted based on the content of the page you are viewing rather than your personal data.
